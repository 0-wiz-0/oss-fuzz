# Fuzzing Gloassary

TODO

Naming things is hard. This page tries to reduce confusion around naming.

* **Fuzz Target** or
* **Target Function** or
* **Fuzzing Target Function** a function to which we apply fuzzing at the hopes to find a bug.
A [specific signature](libfuzzer.info#fuzz-target) must be used for OSS-Fuzz.

<BR>

* **Fuzzing Engine** a program that tries to find interesting inputs
