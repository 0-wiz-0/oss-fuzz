# Fuzzing Gloassary

TODO

Naming things is hard. This page tries to reduce confusion around naming.

* **Fuzz Target**
* **Target Function**
* **Fuzzing Target Function** a function to which we apply fuzzing at the hopes to find a bug.
A [specific signature](libfuzzer.info#fuzz-target) must be used for OSS-Fuzz.
